# hello-world
disposable test repository

I changed this file in Notepad++ at 3:45am CT on Oct 2nd, 2017

where does this change show up?

hmmmm - what if I make changes to the file directly with Git open?
What will it do with these changes?

This would be more like the regular changes I make.

Let me add a little more.
